# N-Queen-Problem
This project implements the Hill Climbing search algorithm and its variants to solve the classic N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The Hill Climbing algorithm and its variants are used to intelligently explore the solution space and find a configuration where no queens attack each other.
